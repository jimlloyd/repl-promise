repl-promise
============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jimlloyd/repl-promise.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jimlloyd/repl-promise)

A REPL for using Q promises for the implementation.
Due to the nature of the implementation, if a script procesed by the REPL returns a promise the REPL will wait for the promise to be fulfilled to display the resolved result.
